Be sure you have the proper development packages for your distribution
installed. For example, on debian you need at least one of libqt4-dev,
libgtk2.0-dev, libgtk1.2-dev or libfltk1.3-dev. Also, be sure to have
the XTest extension and its development files. Again, on debian, you
need libxtst6 and libxtst-dev.

After that, run:

./configure

and if all is fine (at least one GUI must be set to yes), run:

make
sudo make install
