Be sure you have the proper development packages for your distribution
installed. For example, on Debian you need at least one of libqt4-dev, qtbase5-dev,
libgtk-3-dev or libfltk1.3-dev. Also, be sure to have the XTest extension
and its development files. Again, on Debian, you need libxtst6 and libxtst-dev.

After that, run:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

and if all is fine (at least one GUI must be set to yes), run:

cmake --build .
sudo make install
