This autoclicker application enables you to automatically click the left mousebutton. It is designed to reduce strain on the wrist muscles caused by repetitive mouse clicking, which can lead to serious injury or impair (RSI, Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, et cetera). By specifying the interval, a random factor and the number of times to click, the program simulates natural clicking.

Possible fields of use are (obviously) programs that require a lot of repetitive clicking, but it can also be used to click restart every ten minutes in a presentation program.

Currently, xAutoClick has GUI front-ends for X11/console, X11/GTK+ 3.0, X11/Qt 4.x, X11/Qt 5.x and X11/FLTK and has been tested on Linux/x86.

For compilation/installation instructions, see INSTALL.
