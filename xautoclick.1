.SH DESCRIPTION
This application enables you to automatically click the left mousebutton.
It is designed to reduce strain on the wrist muscles caused by repetitive
mouse clicking, which can lead to serious injury or impair (RSI, Carpal
Tunnel Syndrome, et cetera).
By specifying the interval, a random factor and the number of times to click,
the program simulates natural clicking.
.SH GUI
This section applies to all GUI versions, but, obviously, not to the
command line version.
For the command line version, see below.
.PP
The GUI consists of several spinboxes and buttons.
The parameters have the following meaning: (all times are in milliseconds)
.TP
pre-delay
the time the application waits before it starts clicking after you have
clicked start.
.TP
interval
the time the application waits between two clicks.
.TP
random +/-
for each click, the application adds or substracts a random factor between
zero and this value to/from the interval time.
.TP
number of clicks
the number of times the application clicks.
.PP
You can also use the tap button to click a rythm.
The application tries to determine the correct parameters to mimic that
clicking behaviour.
Click the start button to start.
While it is running you can click stop to stop the clicking before it reaches
the number of clicks specified.
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
